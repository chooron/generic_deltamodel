## Generic, Scalable Differentiable Modeling Framework
#### Backbone for `hydroDL2.0` w/ hydrology models (see 1.0 [here](https://github.com/mhpi/hydroDL))

A domain-agnostic Python framework for developing trainable differentiable models.
Following as a generalization of `hydroDL`, `generic_diffModel` (or `dMG`) aims
to expand differentiable parameter learning capabilities beyond hydrology. Those
wishing to run hydrologic tasks tied to MHPI's research can couple `dMG` with
physics models and data processors from `hydroDL2.0`.
