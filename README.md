## Generic, Scalable Differentiable Modeling Framework
#### Backbone for `hydroDL2.0` w/ hydrology models (1.0 [here](https://github.com/mhpi/hydroDL))

A domain-agnostic Python framework for developing trainable differentiable models.
Following as a generalization of `hydroDL`, `generic_diffModel` (or `dMG`) aims
to expand differentiable parameter learning capabilities beyond hydrology. 

Those wishing to run hydrologic tasks tied to MHPI's research can couple `dMG`
with physics models and data processors from
[`hydroDL2.0`](https://github.com/mhpi/hydroDL2). The `hydroDL2.0` package also
contains hydrology-oriented augmentations to differential model capabilities.
